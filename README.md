I'm a **Full-stack Software Engineer** with over **5 years of experience**. I started as a Mobile developer at Avila Tek, working with **Flutter** to create beautiful and complex applications for different clients. Then I advanced through my career and ascended to Manager of Mobile Department at Avila Tek in 2024. I imparted the Algorithms & Programming course in my university for 2 years, and the **Go Backend Developer** bootcamp in the Latam regional area in Mercado Libre, where we trained junior developers backend development in **Go**, REST APIs, relational databases and CI/CD practices.

In the present, I'm actively working as a Full-stack Engineer, mainly in Go and cloud computing. I'm soon to be certified as AWS Cloud Practitioner!
