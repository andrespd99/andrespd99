# Howdy, I'm Andres! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Full-stack Software Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** in **Flutter** and JavaScript, a former university teacher for 2 years, and **Go** enthusiast.

I'm **Software Manager Engineer** at [Avila Tek](https://avilatek.com/), a software factory in Venezuela. I have worked on many projects with Flutter, with which I have launched +10 apps to stores.

I've worked most of my career mainly as a frontend developer in Flutter, but I've also worked with Node.JS, Python, and JavaScript. Recently, I've been learning Go, and I'm excited to see where this journey will take me.

Currently, I'm working on an API made in Go with Airtable + Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Render Cloud.
